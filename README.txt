This is my first project managed with GITHUB, and I am committing the project which I have been working on to help with filing silk screens at my job. The code is a simple file system for creating, deleting, and updating entries in a numbered library, with search functions. There are also several features including a Javascript price calculator and a PDF form to create invoices. The PHP scripts I have cobbled together from various sources, particulary David Powers, and my own Javascript and PHP which I intend to clean up and improve over time.


The initial commit is simply my specific program, which connects to a database(which I created with phpmyadmin), so to use it one must apply the changes relative to the database and users. My goal is to make the code eventually user-friendly, and possibly later create a drupal module integrating the capabilities. 

I believe this program can be useful for many applications, and is fairly simple to implement and understand. If anyone wants to chip in, I would appreciate the input, as I am new to Git.
